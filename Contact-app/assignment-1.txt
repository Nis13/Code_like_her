Commit your changes with clear and meaningful commit messages.
Create a Pull Request for each feature or bug fix and merge them after review.
Submission:
Push your code to a remote repository on GitHub.
Include a README file explaining how to run the application locally and any additional information about the project.
Bonus:
Implement React Router for navigation between different views.
Add form validation for adding and editing items.
Explore and use any React 18 features that are relevant to your application.
